# Jack Silver is a spy from the international spy agency.
# In his current mission he observes his targets at a roulette table at the Great Grand Casino in Villan City.
# He needs to know how much money his targets have at the end of the game.
# The target plays as follows:
# - He always bets 1/4 of the cash he currently has. If it is a fractional value, he always rounds up.
# - The target's calls, CALL, can be one of the three possibilities:
# -- EVEN - He bets on an EVEN (non-zero) number
# -- ODD - He bets on an ODD number
# -- PLAIN - He bets on a specific number: NUMBER
# NOTE: Since the odds of winning are much lower for PLAIN bets, the payout for a win is higher: 35 to 1. 
# For EVEN and ODD, the payout is 1 to 1. 
# As an example, if the ball comes up as 23, and the target bets 100, the payouts would be as follows:
# - If he called EVEN, then he would lose his 100 bet.
# - If he called ODD, then he would get his 100 bet back, plus an extra 100.
# - If he called PLAIN and specified any number other than 23, he would lose his 100 bet.
# - If he called PLAIN and specified 23 as his number, he would get back his 100 bet plus an extra 3500.
