# An international Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock tournament is organized, 
# all players receive a number when they register.
# 
# Each player chooses a sign that he will keep throughout the tournament among:
# Rock (R)
# Paper (P)
# sCissors (C)
# Lizard (L)
# Spock (S)
# 
# Scissors cuts Paper
# Paper covers Rock
# Rock crushes Lizard
# Lizard poisons Spock
# Spock smashes Scissors
# Scissors decapitates Lizard
# Lizard eats Paper
# Paper disproves Spock
# Spock vaporizes Rock
# Rock crushes Scissors
# and in case of a tie, the player with the lowest number wins (it's scandalous but it's the rule).
