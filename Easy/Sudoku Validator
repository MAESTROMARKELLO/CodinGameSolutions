# You get a sudoku grid from a player and you have to check if it has been correctly filled.
# A sudoku grid consists of 9×9 = 81 cells split in 9 sub-grids of 3×3 = 9 cells.
# For the grid to be correct, each row must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9), 
# each column must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9) 
# and each sub-grid must contain one occurrence of each digit (1 to 9).
# You shall answer true if the grid is correct or false if it is not.
