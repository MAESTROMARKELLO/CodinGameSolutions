# Casablanca’s hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. 
# During a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. 
# In order for the race to be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar strength.
# Write a program which, using a given number of strengths, 
# identifies the two closest strengths and shows their difference with an integer (≥ 0).
